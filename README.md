# Deep Learning for ECG Classification


## Data
The data used in this project was simulated using Neurokit library and time series augmentation technique. \
we add three ecg noise type to the data to perform our experiments.  

## Code
The code is divided as follows:
* utils folder contains necessary functions to simulate datasets.
* ecgsimulation folder contains functions to simulate datasets.
* classifiers folder contains three notebooks for training the deep neural network in our paper.


## Prerequisites
* numpy
* pandas
* Neurokit
* scipy
* tsaug
* tensorflow
* keras
